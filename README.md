# Clonify
Create files based on a sample file and a desired set of replacement words

- Insert base file into ``/input/``
- Modify ``changes.txt`` so that:
1. the first line is the target string you want to modify for all files
2. the second line is a list of output strings seperated by commas
- Run ``run.bat`` to run the script

You can input as many files as you like into ``/input/`` as long as they contian the target word, check the demo contained in ``/input/`` for an example.
